# Connecting Dialogflow and Fonoster

[Rox AI](https://github.com/fonoster/rox) is a connector between Dialogflow and Fonoster. Rox AI is for creating Programmable Voice Applications without having to do any coding.

## Requirements

Before you start this guide, you will need Docker and a set of Google Cloud Credentials with access to Speech APIs and your Dialogflow project.

## Overview

## Preparing the environment

Rox AI ships as a Docker container, and has everything you need to connect with Dialogflow. All it takes is a few environment variables. 

In your favorite IDE open the `.env` file, and then copy and paste the following content:

```bash
// .env
# Uncomment if you need authentication
# NGROK_AUTH=
NGROK_PROTOCOL=http
NGROK_PORT=rox:3000
ASR_ENGINE=google
TTS_ENGINE=google
TTS_VOICE=en-US-Wavenet-F
INTENTS_ENGINE=dialogflow.es
CONFIG=.
```

Next, open a file named `docker-compose.yml` and paste the content of this YAML.

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  rox:
    image: fonoster/rox:latest
    # Be sure to remove this while in production 
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 3001:3001
    environment:
      - INTENTS_ENGINE
      - INTENTS_ENGINE_AGENT
      - INTENTS_ENGINE_LOCATION
      - ASR_ENGINE
      - TTS_ENGINE
      - TTS_VOICE
      - INITIAL_DTMF
      - WELCOME_INTENT_TRIGGER
      - ACTIVATION_INTENT
      - INTERACTION_TIMEOUT
      - EVENTS_ENABLED
      - ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT
      - LANGUAGE_CODE  
    volumes:
      - ${CONFIG}/google.json:/home/fonoster/.fonoster/google.json
    networks:
      - default

  ngrok:
    image: wernight/ngrok:latest
    ports:
      - 4040:4040
    environment:
      - NGROK_PROTOCOL
      - NGROK_PORT
      - NGROK_AUTH
    depends_on:
      - rox
    networks:
      - default
```

By now, your folder should look like this:

```bash
$ tree -a
.
├── .env
├── docker-compose.yml
└── google.json

0 directories, 3 files
```

## Running the Connector

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You are all set! Look for [Ngrok's URL](http://localhost:4040/inspect/http), and use the value as the Webhook of your Fonoster Number.

# Receive and respond to a call

Fonoster can accept calls from different sources such as phones, web pages, and mobile devices, and connect them with your Programmable Voice Application using a webhook.

When your Fonoster Number receives an incoming phone call, it will send an HTTP request to a server you control. This callback mechanism is known as a webhook. When Fonoster sends your application a request, it expects a response in a JSON format that tells it how to respond to the call.

If everything went well with the prior guides, all is left is calling to your Number using a mobile or landline. Your output should look similar to this:

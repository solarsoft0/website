# Create an User Account

> If you already have a Fonoster account and a phone number, you're all set here! [Log in](https://console.fonoster.io) and feel free to jump to the next step.

Before you can make a call from Node.js, you will need an `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and an `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`. Notice that the credentials for your User account are different from your Project's credentials, and it will have the `US` prefix (i.e: `US618572e3ec11d10600000001`)

With your User account, you will be able to:

- Manage User settings
- Create and manage Projects

To obtain your credentials, you'll need to [sign up](https://console.fonoster.io) for a Fonoster account or [login](https://console.fonoster.io) to an account you already have.
